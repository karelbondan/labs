# CSCI336 - Assignment 1
## Description

Make a 2D scene that contains 6 enlarged points, 2 triangles, 3 lines, and one square. Change the background color when certain keys are pressed on the keyboard. Make sure that the background color does not overlap with the object colors that render them imperceptible. 

## Time required to finish

2 days 

## Hardest section of the assignment

Constructing the vertices since they have to be done manually, hence forcing me to imagine how the object draws on screen while also trial-and-erroring to see how they actually render in the window.
